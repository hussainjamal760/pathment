/**
 * A mentor sees and grades THEIR mentees. Nobody else's.
 *
 * Every scope decision in this service used to be made from `user.role` — the
 * column recording what an account was CREATED as, not what the person does
 * now. A co-mentor promoted from a mentee account still reads 'mentee' there,
 * so `userRole !== 'mentor'` fell through to the unrestricted branch and the
 * AI evaluation they kicked off graded the whole organisation: the progress bar
 * read "0 / 623" for someone responsible for a dozen people.
 *
 * The same mistake, in the other direction, meant the delete and revoke guards
 * (`if (user.role === 'mentor')`) never matched for that person and were
 * skipped entirely.
 *
 * Scope is derived from the permission they actually hold at a clan now, and
 * the default is CLOSED: no clans means no mentees, never everybody.
