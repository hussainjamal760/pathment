/**
 * Which key does which job.
 *
 * The phone could add an AI key and had no way to say what it was for, so an
 * organisation with a cheap key and an expensive one could not spend the
 * expensive one only where it matters, and nobody could see which key had
 * scored an applicant.
 *
 * The trap pinned here is that the server rewrites the routing map WHOLE: any
 * feature left out of the request comes back null. A client that sent only the
 * feature it had just changed would silently unroute the other eleven, and
 * nothing would look broken because an unrouted feature still falls back to a
 * working key.
