/**
 * A streak milestone is paid once.
 *
 * It was not. The award was decided by `milestonesCrossed(previous, current)`,
 * where `previous` is the counter on the mentee profile — and that counter goes
 * to zero whenever a streak breaks, or whenever a recount lands on a day before
 * the mentee has logged. Whatever the cause, the next call asked "what lies
 * between 0 and 60" and paid 7, 14, 30 and 60 all over again.
 *
 * Production, before this fix: 8,250 points across eleven mentees. One was paid
 * the seven-day bonus eight times. The mentee at the top of the leaderboard
 * showed 3,276 points and had genuinely earned 1,326 — 2,600 of her total was
 * streak bonuses against 141 points of completed work, which is what made the
 * board meaningless to everyone below her.
 *
 * What has been paid is now read from the ledger, so no counter can re-open it.
