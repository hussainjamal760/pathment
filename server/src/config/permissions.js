 * The same vocabulary, grouped and in words, for anything that has to show it

 *
 * It lives here because it was living in the admin web page instead, hardcoded,
 * and had already fallen behind: `mentee.transfer` and `feedback.manage` were
 * missing from it, so neither could be granted to a custom role through the
 * only screen that grants them. A list of permissions kept next to a screen
 * drifts from the list of permissions kept next to the code. This one cannot,
 * and a test asserts every permission appears exactly once.
 *
 * The labels are what somebody choosing sees, so they are written as the thing
 * being allowed rather than as the key with the dots taken out.
