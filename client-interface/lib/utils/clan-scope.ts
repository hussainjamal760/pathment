/**
 * How the sidebar's clan picker narrows a list — one rule, in one place.
 *
 * A mentor can run several clans, and the picker scopes their screens to one of
 * them. Each screen used to implement that filter itself, which produced two
 * recurring faults:
 *
 *   1. **The badge and the list disagreed.** The sidebar counted every unread
 *      conversation while the inbox counted only the selected clan's, so a
 *      mentor could read "No conversations yet" with a red 1 beside Messages.
 *   2. **The empty state blamed the data.** A list emptied by the picker said
 *      "All caught up" or "No mentees yet" — which is false when the work is
 *      simply sitting in another clan, and indistinguishable from a real bug.
 *
 * The rule below also refuses to hide what it cannot attribute. A conversation
 * with an admin belongs to no clan; a submission from a mentee matched 1:1 has
 * no clan either. Dropping those from every clan view makes them unreachable,
 * so they show in all of them instead. This mirrors the server's own rule when
 * it splits the inbox by role: never hide what cannot be classified.
